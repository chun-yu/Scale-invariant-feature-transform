# Scale-invariant-feature-transform
SIFT - a feature detection algorithm to detect and describe local features in images.

sift_point.py is a simply SIFT code in python. Can input the image to find keypoints of objects in the image.

sift _adaptive_contrast_threshold.py is a python code based on the paper "SIFT Detector Boosted by Adaptive Contrast Threshold to Improve Matching Robustness of Remote Sensing Panchromatic Images".
